# Shopping Guidelines

## Strategy
We want to minimize the amount of groceries that we need to acquire. As such we want to center the meal choices around foods which can be used more than once throughout the week.

## Store Preference
Choose products from these stores by preference order.
1. Aldi
2. Costco
   1. only if better value or unavailable from Aldi
3. Sams Club
4. County Market

Optimize for cost per serving
